[mod-setting-description]
scrap-industry-no-mercy=Enable scrap byproducts for even the basic intermediates of gears, cables, and sticks
scrap-industry-plastic=Scrap from crafting with plastic bars and low density structure
scrap-industry-mech=Scrap from crafting with gears and engines
scrap-industry-metallurgy=Melt scrap down into their molten counterparts
scrap-industry-lithium=Dust from crafting with Lithium on Aquilo
scrap-industry-volatile-lithium=In case you like Lithium scrap, but don't want your base to explode
scrap-industry-handcraft=Create hidden duplicates of recipes to allow seamless handcrafting
scrap-industry-byproduct-scale=Global modifier for how much scrap byproduct to add to recipes. Anything greater than 1 may be imbalanced
scrap-industry-failrate-min=A value of 0.01 means any recipe with byproducts will have at best a 99% success chance. A value of 0 means more expensive recipes are allowed to reach a 100% success chance
scrap-industry-rust=Make iron scrap able to rust, combined with Roc's Rusting Iron
scrap-industry-no-scrap-scrap=Recipes that use scrap will not generate more scrap
scrap-industry-unhide-recipe-signals=Makes hidden recipe signals visible, which can resolve issues with trying to set recipes via the circuit network
